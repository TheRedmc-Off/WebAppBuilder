# WebAppBuilder

This new project is a website to app tool created with python and Nativefier npm package.
This is my second github repo!


## Warnings

- This script is only compatible with Windows 10 or 11 (or any Windows OS that is up-to-date and where latest NodeJS version is installed).

- This script is NOT compatible with other OS than Windows! It builds .EXE files and dependencies that are only compatible with this OS.

- The Web-App that you built with this tool needs to be deleted and rebuilt after a long time in order to update the Chromium libs and to keep it functionning!



## Features

- Asks the user for opening the folder where it is located

- Saves the app folder to Desktop for easy retrieval after use!
  
- Updates the Nativefier npm package at every use for stable results




## Installation

Download the latest release or download source code to compile it
    
## Running Tests

To run debugging tests, just take the source code and run the file in any python interpreter


## Roadmap

- Add a functionnality to open the app once the build is done
