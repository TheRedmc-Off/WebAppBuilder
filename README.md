# WebAppBuilder

This new project is a website to app tool created with python and Nativefier npm package.
This is my second github repo!
This script is only compatible with Windows 10 or 11 (or any Windows OS that is up-to-date and where latest NodeJS version is installed).
This script is NOT compatible with other OS than Windows! It builds .EXE files and dependencies that are only compatible with this OS.



## Features

- Asks the user for opening the folder where it is located

- Saves the app folder to Desktop for easy retrieval after use!
  
- Updates the Nativefier npm package at every use for stable results




## Installation

Download the latest release or download source code to compile it
    
## Running Tests

To run debugging tests, just take the source code and run the file in any python interpreter


## Roadmap

- Add a functionnality to open the app once the build is done
